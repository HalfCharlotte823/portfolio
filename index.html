            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I usually spend my time doing one of three things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing lots of video games. These games include Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite, Cyberpunk, Helldivers, and a lot more.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Writing stories. I've made hundreds of stories, with interesting characters and worlds.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Studying the fundementals of balancing. From Pokemon, to battlegrounds games and fighting games, I extensively study and look over all I can. As I am working on multiple projects relating to Pokemon, and a single project relating to a fighting game, I have to make sure the games are fun, enjoyable, and fair for all players.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="indexdiv projects">
            <h3>Small Projects</h3>
            <p>Speaking of the projects I mentioned in my hobbies, I have a few definetly smaller projects that don't warrent a spot in the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> tab. So here they are!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A huge Minecraft map, which primarily uses the mod Cobblemon. All loot, locations, biomes, and story made exclusively by me.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A custom Pokemon region. With two actually good rivals, an evil team that poses a threat throughout the whole playthrough, and a difficult gym challenge that keeps you on edge the whole time.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A Jujutsu Kaisen-Based battlegrounds game. I've made 20 characters, all with 8-9 moves. A tutorial that talks about all things related to fighting games, a PvE mode that makes people have to work for characters, and the works.</li>
            </ol>
